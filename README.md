need to think of a better way in which JS code can construct operations

use color to indicate the kind of sheet

how to make it super fast?

operations todo
* shift-F - enter
  * filter by exact match
* pivot
* sort
* insert

# potential bugs
rename columns
* problem - if shift-F is done twice, both columns are called `count_star()`

frontend-interactivity
* how would column shifting work?
* hiding columns

# potential features
* add a button for assigning to curators after filtering

# how will these be tackled?
column types
* if we make all of them string, how will we plot floats like age
* NaN values
* operations on columns
* passing long exact matches by url

interface for excluding columns

polly-wide updates
